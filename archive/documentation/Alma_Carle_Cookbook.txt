develop the gluten. Form the dough into a ball and place in a bowl coated with a 
nonstick vegetable spray. Cover, and let rise in a warm place (80° to 85° F), until 
doubled in bulk (one and one-half to two hours). Punch down the dough and let it rest for

an electric mixer, 300 strokes by hand). Mix in egg whites. Add one more cup of flour 
and beat for another minute. Add more flour and continue to beat until the dough is too 
stiff to continue. Turn out onto a floured board and knead for eight to ten minutes, adding 
remaining flour as needed. Do not stint on the kneading time as it is necessary to 
develop the gluten. Form the dough into a ball and place it into a bowl coated with a 
nonstick vegetable spray. Cover, and let rise in the oven at 80° to 85° F, until doubled in 
bulk (takes one and one-half to two hours). Punch down the dough and let it rest for ten 
minutes. Then roll dough out to a thickness of from 1/2 to 3/4 inch. Brush or spread with 
melted margarine and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Roll up (like a jelly roll) and cut 
crosswise at a thickness of 1 inch or as desired. Leaving space between the rolls for

DINNER ROLLS (Alma Finken Carle)
?	Ingredients
?	3 to 3 & 1/2 cups of sifted bread flour (can use all purpose flour)
?	1 package of dry yeast
?	1 cup of milk (2%, 1/2%, or skim)
?	2 tablespoons of oil
?	2 tablespoons of sugar
?	1 teaspoon of salt
?	Instructions Sift together about 1/3 of the flour and all of the yeast. Heat milk, oil, sugar 
and salt over low heat until hot to the finger, but no more. Stir to dissolve sugar and salt. 
Add liquids to the flour-yeast mixture and beat with an electric mixer at medium speed 
for two minutes, or 300 strokes by hand. Add another one-half to one cup of flour and 
beat for another minute with the electric mixer. Stir in enough more flour to make a soft 
dough. Turn onto a floured board and knead until smooth and elastic (eight to ten 
minutes). Place in a bowl that has been coated with a nonstick vegetable spray. Spray 
the top of the mixture with the nonstick vegetable spray. Cover with wax paper and over 
that place a dry cloth. Put in a warm place (80° to 85° F), free from drafts, and let rise 
until doubled (about one hour). Punch dough down. Turn out onto a floured board again 
and shape into any desired form. Place rolls on baking sheets that have been lightly 
coated with a nonstick vegetable spray, or in muffin cups and let rise again until doubled 
(takes one to one & one-half hours). Pre-heat oven to 425° F. Bake for about ten 
minutes and serve "piping hot".
DINNER ROLL SHAPES
?	Cloverleaf Rolls: Form dough into little balls about 1/2" in diameter. Coat with a

Roll out the dough to a scant 1/4" thickness. Cut wedges from a six inch circle. Or, roll 
dough into a rectangle three inches wide, cut into squares, and make triangles by slicing 
diagonally. Brush with butter flavored oil, or margarine. Or, coat with a butter flavored 
nonstick vegetable spray. Roll up the triangles, starting with the wide end, and curve into 
crescents.
?	Parkerhouse Rolls: Roll dough out the dough to a thickness of 1/4". Cut with a three 
inch biscuit cutter. Make a depression with a spoon just below the center of each circle. 
Brush with margarine or coat with a butter flavored nonstick vegetable spray, and fold 
over from the top envelope fashion. The lower part with the depression should be larger 
than the upper portion.
?	Fantans: Roll out the dough into an 1/8" thick rectangle. Cut into one-inch strips. Brush 
with margarine or coat with butter flavored nonstick vegetable spray. Pile six or seven 
strips one on top of the other. Cut pieces about 1 & 1/4" long and place in muffin cups 
(that have been coated with a nonstick vegetable spray) with the cut sides up. They will 
open out in a fan shape as they bake.
