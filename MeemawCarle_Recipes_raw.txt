BATCH 1 START

MEMORANDUM FROM WILFRED CARLE April 8, 1995  These recipes are those that are in use by Alma Finken Carle. Some of them were handed down from her Mother, Clara Keller Finken, some from her Grandmother Keller; others were handed down from Wilfred's grandmothers, Caroline Nagel, and Lizzie Walters.  Other recipes were from friends, recipe books and magazines. Most of them were modified by substituting egg substitutes for eggs, vegetable oils for lard, shortening, or animal fats. Changes were also made to accommodate taste preferences.

fresh ground black pepper to taste 

Bake whole peppers in oven at 350° F to 375° F for 30 minutes or more until wilted - turn from time to time while baking. Mix all other ingredients and let stand while peppers are baking. Skin the peppers, core, remove seeds, and cut into small slices. Pour marinade over peppers (add 2 tablespoons of capers, if desired) and let stand until cool, or overnight if time permits. 

FROSTED PINEAPPLE SQUARES 

1/2 cup of sugar 

1/4 teaspoon of salt 

1 can (1 lb, 14 oz) pineapple chunks 

1 teaspoon of sugar 

1/2 cup of milk 

1 cup of margarine 

Confectioners' sugar frosting 

3 tablespoons of cornstarch 

1 egg yolk*, slightly beaten 

3 3/4 to 4 1/4 cups unsifted flour 

Brend & Coffe Cum 

1 pkg Fleischmann's active dry yeast 

1/2 cup of water 

4 egg yolks* (at room temperature) (*OR egg substitute) 

Mix 1/2 cup of sugar, cornstarch and salt together in saucepan. Stir in slightly beaten egg yolk and undrained pineapple chunks. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil. Set aside to cool.  In a large bowl, thoroughly mix 1 & 1/3 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon of sugar, and undissolved yeast. Combine milk, water, and margarine in a saucepan. Heat over low heat until liquids are warm. (Margarine does not need to melt). Gradually add to dry ingredients and beat for 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally.  Add egg yolks and 1/2 cup of flour, or just enough flour to make a thick batter. Beat at high speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in enough additional flour to make a soft, moist dough.  Divide dough in half. Roll out 1/2 of the dough on floured board to fit the bottom of an ungreased 15 1/2 x 10 1/2 x 1 inch jelly roll pan. Spread with cooled pineapple filling. Roll remaining dough large enough to cover filling. Seal edges together. Snip surface of the dough with scissors to let steam escape.  Cover, let rise in warm place, free from draft, until doubled in bulk. This will take about 1 hour. Bake in moderate oven (375°F) about 35 to 40 minutes, or until done. Let cake cool in pan. Frost while warm with confectioners' sugar frosting. Cut into squares to serve.

Roast for 30 to 40 minutes at 250° F - check every ten minutes. Recipe from DeeDee Nofziger

Add more flour and continue to beat until the dough is too stiff to continue.  Turn out onto a floured board and knead for eight to ten minutes, adding remaining flour as needed. Do not stint on the kneading time as it is necessary to develop the gluten.  Form the dough into a ball and place in a bowl coated with a nonstick vegetable spray. Cover, and let rise in a warm place (80° to 85° F), until doubled in bulk (one and one-half to two hours).  Punch down the dough and let it rest for ten minutes. Then shape it into rolls, buns, wreaths, etc. Place into pans coated with a nonstick vegetable spray, and brush tops with oil. Cover and let rise again until doubled (thirty to forty-five minutes).  Bake in a pre-heated 350° F oven for twenty to twenty-five minutes, depending on size. Remove from pans immediately.

ICE BOX PICKLES Recipe from Terry Roshaven Take 18 pounds of fresh cucumbers; scrub well. Either cut in one-half inch CHUNKS, or process as whole cucumbers. Soak for four days in one and one-half gallons of water to which has been added one cup of pickling salt. Cover with plate and weigh down. Rinse and slice, then mix three ounces of alum in enough water to cover cucumbers. Cover, and keep in refrigerator overnight. Drain and rinse. Then soak cucumbers in enough (about one gallon) of 5% white vinegar to cover, for six hours. Drain and save vinegar for use later (not in this recipe). Place pickles in crock with seven to ten pounds of sugar and one-half box of pickling spices. Stir and turn the chunks until all of the sugar is dissolved. The amount of sugar used is a matter of personal preference. It is better to begin with a small quantity of sugar and add more until the desired taste is achieved.

To make 1/5 of the recipe, use:

3 & 1/2 to 4 pounds of cucumbers

pickling spices

3 cups of sugar

5% vinegar, enough to cover cucumbers

SPRINGERLE Makes about 4 dozen cookies Preferred over Original Carle Recipe

4 cups sifted all purpose flour

4 eggs (or egg substitute)

10 drops anise oil

anise seeds, crushed (optional)

1 teaspoon baking soda

4 cups powdered sugar

1 lemon rind (grated)

food coloring/water (optional)

Sift flour with baking soda, set aside. With electric mixer, beat eggs until very light. Add powdered sugar, a tablespoon at a time and continue beating until mixture resembles a soft meringue. This will take at least 15 minutes with a mixer at high speed, or 30 minutes of beating by hand. Add anise oil and grated lemon rind. Blend in sifted flour mixture. Cover tightly and let stand 15 or 20 minutes (or refrigerate). Roll out a small portion at a time on lightly floured surface to about 1/4" thickness. Press floured springerle mold or rolling pin firmly into the dough, then lift off carefully, to make clear impressions. Cut the cookies apart with pastry wheel or a sharp knife. Brush off excess flour with a dry pastry brush. Place cookies on un-greased flat trays or cookie sheets. Cover with a towel and let dry at room temperature overnight, or longer. The drying step is very important, do not omit it. In the morning the Springerle will be soft on the bottom and dry on the top.

(Side 2 of 2) Transfer cookies to a cookie sheet that has been coated with a nonstick vegetable spray and sprinkled with crushed anise seeds. Bake in a pre-heated 300° F oven ten to fifteen minutes, or until cookies are the color of light straw. Do not over bake. Transfer to wire racks to cool. When cookies have cooled completely, the designs on them can be painted, if desired. This is done with a paintbrush dipped in food coloring that has been diluted with water. Keep the colors light. Let dry completely. Store in airtight container; if cookies become hard, place a slice of potato or apple in the container. Cookies can be frozen. Note: This is an excellent cookie dough which should roll out easily and keep a clear imprint. The amount of anise oil gives a mild flavor. Cookies are soft inside with a crisp outer layer. Sprinkle any anise seeds remaining on baking sheets into container in which you store the Springerle. The seeds will perfume the cookies with additional anise fragrance.
